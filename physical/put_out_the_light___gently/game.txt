How to play / Interaction:
Put your finger over the photoresistor. Try to stop when the yellow LED lights up. Press the button to reset (wait 3s).

Game objective:
Try to time it to get the higher score than the other person (use the interpretation below).

Challenge:
Timing is difficult.

Scenario Score Interpretation (highest to lowest):
yellow LED lights up without the red LED lights up (very difficult)
Both yellow and red light up
Only green light up (hold too little)
All LED are out (hold too long)

Note:
Recommend to not play this in somewhere extremely dim or bright as it will be more difficult or borderline impossible to interact with the photoresistor.
