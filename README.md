    - [ ] :sparkles: recolor character
    - [X] :star2: idle animation
    - [ ] :question: make `BABA` `IS` `YOU` block functional
      - [X] array to represent the grid for performance optimization :zap:
        - [X] movement should update the array
      - [X] character class for `BABA`
        - [X] character ID system for easier character creation
          - [ ] a better ID system to check for properties of the objects?
        - [X] check collision
        - [X] make push functional
        - [X] implement push/collision for multiple objects
        - [X] implement push/collision for multiple **different** objects
      - [X] ~~verb class for `IS`~~
      - [X] ~~adjective class for `YOU`~~
      - [X] word class for noun, verb, adj, and simple objects (only wobble sprites)

- [ ] physical
  - [ ] digital io
    - [ ] eight ball morse code
    - [ ] when button is pressed, do one of the reply in morse code

- [ ] final proj
  - keep talking and nobody explode modules
    - general challenges:
      - different game each time (generation?)
    - extra:
      - needy module
      - make it work without arduino (should be easy :cluecless:)
    - p5 display:
      - battery amount, serial #, current module, port

    - modules:
      - c = challenge
      - [ ] wire (c: have to detect the current???)
      - [ ] button (maybe, c: get number from timer)
        - a button, 4 different LEDs
      - [ ] simons says
        - 4 button, 4 different LEDs
      - [ ] memory (c: annoying to code)
        - use 4 buttons or remote
      - [ ] morse code
        - 2 buttons, 1 LED
      - [ ] maze (c: repurpose baba prototype (wall is not push))
        - 4 buttons
      - [ ] password (maybe, boring)
        - 4 buttons (2 to cycle, 2 to move between)
        - maybe use remote so that it's less awkward?

    - custom modules:
      - [ ] maze v2
        - navigate with joystick, directional movement
      - [ ] admin card swipe
        - mogus
      - [ ] calcu-la-tor
        - use the remote to give two correct numbers for an operation and a result
        - ban the use of 0 and 1 (unless result is prime) since they made it too easy?
